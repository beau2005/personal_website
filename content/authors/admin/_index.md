I am an economist specialising in mobility, sustainability, and development economics. I use state of the art experimental, econometric, and machine learning techniques to uncover causal effects of interventions.

I will be joining the Sustainability Economics Group at the University of Hamburg in 2025 working on the [MEEP Project](https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-vwl/professuren/drupp/forschung/meep.html).
