abstract: We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated government
measures on individual mobility choices in Switzerland. Our data is based on over
1,600 people for which we observe all trips during eight weeks before the pandemic
and until May 2021. We find an overall reduction of travel distances by 60 percent,
followed by a gradual recovery during the subsequent re-opening of the economy.
Whereas driving distances have almost completely recovered, public transport re-
mains under-used. The introduction of a requirement to wear a mask in public
transport had no measurable impact on ridership. The individual travel response to
the pandemic varies along socio-economic dimensions such as education and house-
hold size, with mobility tool ownership, and with personal values and lifestyles. We
find no evidence for a significant substitution of leisure travel to compensate for the
reduction in work-related travel.
