abstract: Pigovian transport pricing was implemented in a large-scale field
  experiment in urban areas of Switzerland. The pricing varied across time,
  space and mode of transport. One third of the participants were given a
  financial incentive to reduce their external costs of transport, whereas
  others were provided information only or served as a control group. The
  pricing treatment caused a significant reduction in the external costs of
  transport. This reduction is a consequence of mode substitution and a shift of
  departure times. The effect of providing information in the absence of pricing
  was statistically significant only for subgroups of the sample.
